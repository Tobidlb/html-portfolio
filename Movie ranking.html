<p>This drama is simply one of the best k-dramas I've watched so far. The cast is top tier and the acting is good too.</p>

<h3>Tales of the Nine-tailed [Season 2]</h3>

<p>I loved the first season but the second season has no competition. It's simply the best.</p>

<h3>A virtuous business</h3>

<p>It's about four women who venture into a business that doesn't align with the conservative nature of Koreans in the 1990s</p>
